## TECHNICAL PROFILE
Systems engineer passionate about database internals, performance optimization, and infrastructure automation. Combines low-level PostgreSQL understanding (C extensions, memory management) with practical tool-building (observability suites, CLI automation). Currently exploring AI/ML integration with database systems. Seeking to contribute to scalable, observable data infrastructure.

## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

### Software Engineering Intern – Database Systems
**SKAI Worldwide** | Remote | May 1, 2025 – October 31, 2025
*Specializing in PostgreSQL extensions, graph databases, and AI/ML integration*

- **AgensAI Extension Development:** Implementing AI model support within PostgreSQL, focusing on embedding/inference patterns and extension lifecycle management
- **Cross-Ecosystem Driver Migration:** Adapted Apache AGE's NetworkX integration for AgensGraph, modifying query translation logic to maintain functionality across different graph database implementations
- **Database Tooling Analysis:** Reverse-engineered pgAdmin4 architecture to understand large-scale database management system design patterns and extension points
- **Infrastructure Automation:** Containerized complete PostgreSQL+AgensGraph+Apache AGE development environments using Docker, reducing setup time from hours to minutes
