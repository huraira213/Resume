## PROJECTS

### PostgreSQL C Extension Laboratory | C
- Developed experimental PostgreSQL extensions using Server Programming Interface (SPI)
- Implemented safe memory management practices and modular C architecture for database extensions
- Focused on understanding PostgreSQL internal APIs and extension development patterns

### Database Observability Toolkit | Python
- **Query Profiler:** Built modular tool using `pg_stat_statements` to analyze query performance and generate optimization reports
- **Metrics Collector:** Engineered CLI system to monitor PostgreSQL and OS-level metrics for database health assessment
- **DataInsight:** Integrated profiling and collection modules into cohesive system for automated insight generation
- Demonstrated systems thinking through toolchain development for database performance monitoring

### AgensGraph & Apache AGE Ecosystem Exploration | Python, Docker
- Configured complete graph database stack (AgensGraph, Apache AGE, AGE Viewer) in containerized environments
- Modified driver functions to improve compatibility between Apache AGE's NetworkX integration and AgensGraph
- Gained practical experience with graph query languages (Cypher) and graph database architecture

### Early Systems Programming | C++
- Developed console-based Banking Management System applying object-oriented principles and memory-aware programming
- Built foundational understanding of systems modeling and low-level programming concepts
